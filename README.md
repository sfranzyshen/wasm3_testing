# Wasm3 Testing #

I have had a hell of a time trying to get wasm3 working on the esp8266/esp32 platforms ... this repository is a collection of code I tried and the their results.

I started out using one of the example provided by the wasm3-arduino project.

the files that I used to step through each stage of development ... I can individually verify each code section one by one with success ... but put it all together or multiple parts together and it fails ... usually with no message ... or an obscure error message ... my hopes for wasm3 seem to be dashed ...

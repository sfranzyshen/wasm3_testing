# wasm3 Testing #

I am having a hell of a time getting wasm3 to work on the esp8266 esp32 ... here are the files that I used to step through each stage of development ... I can individually verify each code section one by one with success ... but put it all together or multiple parts together and it fails ... usually with no message ... or an obscure error message ... my hopes for wasm3 seem to be dashed ...
